Overview
========

Kairos provides time series storage using Redis or Mongo backends. Kairos is 
intended to replace RRD and Whisper in situations where the scale and 
flexibility of Redis or Mongo is required. It works with
`gevent <http://www.gevent.org/>`_ out of the box. Kairos is the library
on which `torus <https://github.com/agoragames/torus>`_ is built.

Recommended for python 2.7 and later, it can work with previous versions if you
install `OrderedDict <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ordereddict>`_.

Usage
=====

Kairos supports redis and mongo storage using the same API.

Redis
-----

::

  from kairos import Timeseries
  import redis

  client = redis.Redis('localhost', 6379)
  t = Timeseries(client, type='histogram', read_func=int, intervals={
    'minute':{
      'step':60,            # 60 seconds
      'steps':120,          # last 2 hours
    }
  })

  t.insert('example', 3.14159)
  t.insert('example', 2.71828)
  print t.get('example', 'minute')

Mongo
-----

::

  from kairos import Timeseries
  import pymongo

  client = pymongo.MongoClient('localhost')
  t = Timeseries(client, type='histogram', read_func=int, intervals={
    'minute':{
      'step':60,            # 60 seconds
      'steps':120,          # last 2 hours
    }
  })

  t.insert('example', 3.14159)
  t.insert('example', 2.71828)
  print t.get('example', 'minute')

Each Timeseries will store data according to one of the supported types. The
keyword arguments to the constructor are: ::

  type
    One of (series, histogram, count). Optional, defaults to "series".

    series - each interval will append values to a list
    histogram - each interval will track count of unique values
    count - each interval will maintain a single counter
    gauge - each interval will store the most recent data point

  prefix
    Optional, Redis only, is a prefix for all keys in this timeseries. If 
    supplied and it doesn't end with ":", it will be automatically appended.

  read_func
    Optional, is a function applied to all values read back from the
    database. Without it, values will be strings for Redis, whatever 
    `write_func` defined for Mongo. Must accept a string value for Redis
    (empty string for no data) and can return anything.

  write_func
    Optional, is a function applied to all values when writing. Can be
    used for histogram resolution, converting an object into an id, etc.
    Must accept whatever can be inserted into a timeseries and return an
    object which can be saved according to the rules of Redis or Mongo.

  intervals
    Required, a dictionary of interval configurations in the form of: 

    {
      # interval name, used in Redis and Mongo keys and should conform to best 
      # practices according to the backend type.
      minute: {
        
        # Required. The number of seconds that the interval will cover,
        # or a supported Gregorian interval.
        step: 60,
        
        # Optional. The maximum number of intervals to maintain. If supplied,
        # will use Redis and Mongo expiration to delete old intervals, else 
        # intervals exist in perpetuity.
        steps: 240,
        
        # Optional. Defines the resolution of the data, i.e. the number of 
        # seconds in which data is assumed to have occurred "at the same time".
        # So if you're tracking a month-long time series, you may only need 
        # resolution down to the day, or resolution=86400. Defaults to same
        # value as "step". Can also be a Gregorian interval.
        resolution: 60,
      }
    }

In addition to specifying ``step`` and ``resolution`` in terms of seconds, 
kairos also supports a simplified format for larger time intervals. For
hours (h), days (d), weeks (w), months (m) and years (y), you can use 
the format ``30d`` to represent 30 days, for example.

As of ``0.3.0``, kairos also supports the Gregorian calendar for ``step``
and ``resolution``. Either or both parameters can use the terms ``[daily,
weekly, monthly, yearly]`` to describe an interval. You can also mix these
terms between ``step`` and ``resolution`` (e.g. ``daily`` in 
``1h`` resolutions). The expiration time for Gregorian dates is still defined
in terms of seconds and may not match the  varying month lengths, leap years, 
etc. Gregorian dates are translated into ``strptime``- and ``strftime``-compatible
keys are so may be easier to use in raw form or any integrated tools.

Each retrieval function will by default return an ordered dictionary, though
condensed results are also available. Run ``script/example`` to see standard
output; ``watch -n 4 script/example`` is a useful tool as well.

Inserting Data
--------------

There is one method to insert data, ``Timeseries.insert`` which takes the
followng arguments:


* **name** The name of the statistic
* **value** The value of the statistic (optional for count timeseries)
* **timestamp** `(optional)` The timestamp of the statistic, defaults to ``time.time()`` if not supplied

For ``series`` and ``histogram`` timeseries types, ``value`` can be whatever 
you'd like, optionally processed through the ``write_func`` method before being 
written to storage. Depending on your needs, ``value`` (or the output of 
``write_func``) does not have to be a number, and can be used to track such 
things as unique occurances of a string or references to other objects, such 
as MongoDB ObjectIds. Note that many of the aggregate functions in ``histogram``
expect the data to be real numbers.

For the ``count`` type, ``value`` is optional and should be a float or integer 
representing the amount by which to increment or decrement ``name``; it defaults
to ``1``.

For the ``gauge`` type, ``value`` can be anything and it will be stored as-is.

Data for all timeseries is stored in "buckets", where any Unix timestamp will
resolve to a consistent bucket name according to the ``step`` and ``resolution``
attributes of a schema. A bucket will contain the following data structures for
the corresponding series type.

* **series** list
* **histogram** dictionary (map)
* **count** integer or float
* **gauge** value

Reading Data
------------

There are two methods to read data, ``Timeseries.get`` and ``Timeseries.series``.
``get`` will return data from a single bucket, and ``series`` will return data
from several buckets.

get
***

Supports the following parameters. All optional parameters are keyword arguments.

* **name** The name of the statistic, or a list of names whose data will be joined together.
* **interval** The named interval to read from
* **timestamp** `(optional)` The timestamp to read, defaults to ``time.time()``
* **condensed** `(optional)` **DEPRECATED** Use ``condense`` instead. Support for this will be removed entirely in a future release.
* **transform** `(optional)` Optionally process each row of data. Supports ``[mean, count, min, max, sum]``, or any callable that accepts datapoints according to the type of series (e.g histograms are dictionaries, counts are integers, etc). Transforms are called after ``read_func`` has cast the data type and after resolution data is optionally condensed. If ``transform`` is one of ``(list,tuple,set)``, will load the data once and run all the transforms on that data set. If ``transform`` is a ``dict`` of the form ``{ transform_name : transform_func }``, will run all of the transform functions on the data set.
* **fetch** `(optional)` Function to use instead of the built-in implementations for fetching data. See `Customized Reads`_.
* **process_row** `(optional)` Can be a callable to implement `Customized Reads`_.
* **condense** `(optional)` If using resolutions, ``True`` will collapse the resolution data into a single row. Can be a callable to implement `Customized Reads`_.
* **join_rows** `(optional)` Can be a callable to implement `Customized Reads`_.

Returns a dictionary of ``{ timestamp : data }``, where ``timestamp`` is a Unix timestamp
and ``data`` is a data structure corresponding to the type of series, or whatever 
``transform`` returns.  If not using resolutions or ``condensed=True``, the length 
of the dictionary is 1, else it will be the number of resolution buckets within
the interval that contained data. If ``transform`` is a list, ``data`` will be a 
dictionary of ``{ transform_func : transformed_data }``. If ``transform`` is a ``dict``,
``data`` will be a dictionary of ``{ transform_name : transformed_data }``.

series
******

Almost identical to ``get``, supports the following parameters. All optional parameters are keyword arguments.

* **name** The name of the statistic, or a list of names whose data will be joined together.
* **interval** The named interval to read from
* **start** `(optional)` The timestamp which should be in the first interval of the returned data.
* **end** `(optional)` The timestamp which should be in the last interval of the returned data. 
* **steps** `(optional)` The number of steps in the interval to read, defaults to either ``steps`` in the configuration or 1. Ignored if both ``start`` and ``end`` are defined. If either ``start`` or ``end`` are defined, ``steps`` is inclusive of whatever interval that timestamp falls into.
* **condensed** `(optional)` **DEPRECATED** Use ``condense`` instead. Support for this will be removed entirely in a future release.
* **transform** `(optional)` Optionally process each row of data. Supports ``[mean, count, min, max, sum]``, or any callable that accepts a list of datapoints according to the type of series (e.g histograms are dictionaries, counts are integers, etc). Transforms are called after ``read_func`` has cast the data type and after resolution data is optionally condensed. If ``transform`` is one of ``(list,tuple,set)``, will load the data once and run all the transforms on that data set. If ``transform`` is a ``dict`` of the form ``{ transform_name : transform_func }``, will run all of the transform functions on the data set.
* **fetch** `(optional)` Function to use instead of the built-in implementations for fetching data. See `Customized Reads`_.
* **process_row** `(optional)` Can be a callable to implement `Customized Reads`_.
* **condense** `(optional)` If using resolutions, ``True`` will collapse the resolution data into a single row. Can be a callable to implement `Customized Reads`_.
* **join_rows** `(optional)` Can be a callable to implement `Customized Reads`_.
* **collapse** `(optional)` ``True`` will collapse all of the data in the date range into a single result. Can be a callable to implement `Customized Reads`_.

Returns an ordered dictionary of ``{ interval_timestamp : { resolution_timestamp: data } }``,
where ``interval_timestamp`` and ``resolution_timestamp`` are Unix timestamps
and ``data`` is a data structure corresponding to the type of series, or whatever 
``transform`` returns.  If not using resolutions or ``condensed=True``, the dictionary
will be of the form ``{ interval_timestamp : data }``.

All variations of ``transform`` and the resulting format of ``data`` are the same
as in ``get``.

If both ``start`` and ``end`` are defined, the returned data will start and end
on intervals including those timestamps. If only ``start`` is defined, then the
return data will start with an interval that includes that timestamp, with the
total number of intervals returned defined by ``steps``. If only ``end`` is 
defined, then the return data will end with an interval that includes that 
timestamp, with the total number of intervals preceeding it defined by ``steps``.

It is important to note that the interval timestamps in the returned data will
not necessarily match ``start`` or ``end``. This is because of the consistent
hashing scheme that kairos uses, such that ``start`` and ``end`` will be 
translated into the bucket in which it can be found.

Customized Reads
----------------

**ALPHA** This feature is still being explored and the API may change significantly.

There are times when the data in a timeseries requires processing to
be pushed onto the datastore. 

There are times when one needs custom control over the reading and processing
of data in a timeseries. As there is no good way to do this generically,
the ``get`` and ``series`` API supports several keyword arguments to customize
access to the data. Common use cases are to handle large sets of data that
can be processed in the datastore, and situations where one wants to implement
cutom analysis of the dataset such as calculating variance. 

General
*******

The following functions can be overloaded with keyword parameters to ``get`` and
``series`` (``collapse`` being only used for a series).

fetch
#####

A customized database read function. The usage varies depending on the backends
which are described in detail below.
**IMPORTANT** You are welcome to change the type of the return value, but be
wary that transforms, condense and collapse functionality may not work
properly with the changed data types.


process_row
###########

The function which handles the type casting of the data read from the backend
and also calling the ``read_func`` if it has been defined for the time series.
It is required that you define this function if you overload ``fetch`` such
that the returned data type is not the same as the time series' native format
(``dict`` for histogram, ``list`` for series, etc).

The function must be in the form of ``process_row(timeseries, data)``, where:

* **timeseries** The ``Timeseries`` instance.
* **data** The row data generated by the native or ``fetch`` implementation, not
  including any time stamps.

The function may return any data type, but if it's not the native format of the
time series, additional downstream functions may have to be overloaded.

condense
########

If the ``condense`` argument is a callable, the caller can override how resolution
data is collapsed (reduced) into a single interval. The argument will always be 
in the form of: ::

  {
    'resolution_t0' : <data_t0>,
    'resolution_t1' : <data_t1>,
    ...
    'resolution_tN' : <data_tN>,
  }

Where ``<data_tN>`` is the data returned from the native or ``fetch`` 
implementation and passed through the native or custom ``process_row``
implementation.

The function should return a single value, optionally in the same format as 
``<data_tN>``, but this method could also be used for calculating such
things as rate of change or variance within a time interval.

join_rows
#########

If the ``join_rows`` argument is a callable and the ``name`` parameter to ``get``
or ``series`` is one of ``(list,tuple,set)``, this method will be called to join
the data from several named timeseries into a single result. The argument will
always be in the form of: ::

  [
    <data_series0>,
    <data_series1>,
    ...
    <data_seriesN>
  ]

Where ``<data_series0>`` will be the data within a single timestamp window in
the series' native format or whatever was generated by custom implementations
of ``fetch``, ``process_row`` and/or ``condense``. It is important to note
that not every series will contain data points within a given time interval.

In addition to reducing multiple time series' worth of data within an interval
into a single result, this method could be used to implement cross-series
analytics such as unions, intersections and differentials.

collapse
########

If the ``collapse`` argument is a callable, the caller can override how interval
data is collapsed (reduced) into a single result. The native implementation is to
call the ``condense`` function implemented by a time series. The arguments are
the same as a custom ``condense`` function, as-is the expected return value.

It's important to note that if ``collapse`` is defined, the series will 
automatically be condensed as well, so if ``fetch`` is overloaded to return a 
custom data type, then ``condense`` must also be defined. If ``collapse`` is
``True``, the custom ``condense`` function will be used if defined.

In addition to collapsing the result of a time series into a single data set,
this method could also be used to calculate data across a time series, such as
variance.

transform
#########

As noted previously, ``transform`` can be any callable, list of names or callables,
or a named map of transform names or callables. The transforms will be processed 
after all previous native or custom read functions, including ``collapse``.


Redis
*****

The function must be in the form of ``fetch(handle, key)``, where:

* **handle** Either a Redis client or pipeline instance
* **key** The key for the timeseries data

The return value should correspond to the data type of timeseries, e.g. ``dict``
for a histogram. One should always assume that ``handle`` is both a pipeline
`and` a client, and ``fetch`` should return the result of, e.g. 
``handle.hlen(...)``, but that it cannot be used to return a literal, such
as ``lambda: h,k: { 'foo' : h.hlen(k) }``

Mongo
*****

The function must be in the form of ``fetch(handle, **kwargs)``, where:

* **handle** A PyMongo ``Collection``
* **spec** The (suggested) query specification
* **sort** The (suggested) sort definition for the query
* **method** The suggested method to use on the ``handle``

The required return value depends on the value of ``method``.

* **find_one** Should return a hash in the form ``{ value : <data> }``, where
  ``<data>`` should correspond to the data type of the timeseries, e.g. ``list``
  for a series. May directly return a result from ``pymongo.collection.find_one``.
* **find** Should return an iterable in the form ``[ { value: <data> }, ... ]``,
  where ``<data>`` follows the same rules as ``find_one``.


Deleting Data
-------------

To delete the data, call ``Timeseries.delete`` with the name of your statistic,
and all values in all intervals will be deleted.

Dragons!
--------

Kairos achieves its efficiency by using Redis or Mongo TTLs and data structures
in combination with a key naming scheme that generates consistent keys based on
any timestamp relative to epoch. However, just like 
`RRDtool <http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/>`_, changing any attribute of the
timeseries means that new data will be stored differently than old data. For
this reason it's best to completely delete all data in an old time series
before creating or querying using a new configuration.


Installation
============

Kairos is available on `pypi <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/kairos>`_ and can be installed using ``pip`` ::

  pip install kairos


If installing from source:

* with development requirements (e.g. testing frameworks) ::

    pip install -r development.pip

* without development requirements ::

    pip install -r requirements.pip

Note that kairos does not by default require the redis package, nor does
it require `hiredis <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hiredis>`_ though it is
strongly recommended.

Tests
=====

Use `nose <https://github.com/nose-devs/nose/>`_ to run the test suite. ::

  $ nosetests


Roadmap
=======

* Round-robbin intervals for datastores without TTLs
* Round-robbin databases: memcache (and compatible, e.g. ElastiCache), Riak,
  DynamoDB, SimpleDB, GDBM, Berkeley DB, and more
* Redis optimizations
* Capped collection support for mongo
* Expose the native commands for various data stores (e.g. "sismember") for
  single interval and series queries.
* Bloom filters
* "Native" transforms that leverage data store features (e.g. "length")
* Joined series populate a data structure at query time
* Joined series support concurrency "runner"
